Hello Everyone.

This its the Readme file for my weekly project. This Project Nº5 is about Password Generator where you can create strong password for you credential.

The First step of this project it´s create a Html. I add two button one for create password and other button for copy the password also I add some prompt to customize your password generator from lenght to kind of characters include.

The Second step I apllied to the Html desing and style with CSS make it look better and add some effect to make more atractive the page.

the Third step I create the variable for the password generator linked to prompt for customze the password and  main varible for the function to make run the password generator.
